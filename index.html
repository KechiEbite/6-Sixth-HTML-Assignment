    <h3>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening<br>by ROBERT FROST</h3>
    <p> Whose woods these are I think I know.<br>   
        His house is in the village though;<br>    
        He will not see me stopping here   <br> 
        To watch his woods fill up with snow.<br> <br>   
        
        My little horse must think it queer<br> 
        To stop without a farmhouse near<br> 
        Between the woods and frozen lake<br> 
        The darkest evening of the year.<br> <br> 
        
        He gives his harness bells a shake <br>   
        To ask if there is some mistake. <br> 
        The only other soundâ€™s the sweep  <br>  
        Of easy wind and downy flake.   <br> <br> 
        
        The woods are lovely, dark and deep,  <br>  
        But I have promises to keep,   <br> 
        And miles to go before I sleep,   <br> 
        And miles to go before I sleep.  <br>  
    </p>
