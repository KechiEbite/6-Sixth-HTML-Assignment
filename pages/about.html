    <p>Africa my Africa<br>
        Africa of proud warriors in ancestral Savannahs<br>
        Africa of whom my grandmother sings<br>
        On the banks of the distant river<br>
        I have never known you<br>
        But your blood flows in my veins<br>
        Your beautiful black blood that irrigates the fields<br>
        The blood of your sweat<br>
        The sweat of your work<br>
        The work of your slavery<br>
        Africa, tell me Africa<br>
        Is this your back that is unbent<br>
        This back that never breaks under the weight of humiliation<br>
        This back trembling with red scars<br>
        And saying no to the whip under the midday sun?<br>
        But a grave voice answers me<br>
        Impetuous child that tree, young and strong<br>
        That tree over there<br>
        Splendidly alone amidst white and faded flowers<br>
        That is your Africa springing up anew<br>
        springing up patiently, obstinately<br>
        Whose fruit bit by bit acquires<br>
        The bitter taste of liberty.<br><br>
    <em>(AFRICA MY AFRICA is a poem by David Diop)</em></p>
